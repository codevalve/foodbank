# Multi-tenant Setup Guide

## Overview

The Food Bank Inventory Management System supports multiple organizations (tenants) within a single installation. This guide explains how to set up and manage multiple tenants.

**Note:** Multi-tenant functionality is currently under development. This documentation outlines the planned features and implementation.

## Architecture

### Data Isolation
Each tenant's data is isolated using a combination of:
- Separate database schemas
- Row-level security
- Encrypted data storage

### Resource Sharing
The following resources are shared across tenants:
- Authentication system
- API infrastructure
- Storage infrastructure
- Background job processors

## Features

### Tenant Management
- Basic tenant creation
- Tenant configuration
- Custom domains
- Resource quotas
- Feature flags

### Data Isolation
- Database isolation
- User separation
- File storage isolation
- API rate limiting

### Administration
- Tenant administrator role
- Basic user management
- Resource monitoring
- Usage analytics

## Setup Process

### 1. Creating a New Tenant

Currently, tenants can be created through the admin interface or using the CLI:

```bash
# Using the CLI tool (coming soon)
foodbank-cli tenant create \
  --name "Downtown Food Bank" \
  --admin-email "admin@downtown.org"
```

### 2. Tenant Configuration

Each tenant can be configured using a YAML file:

```yaml
tenant:
  name: "Downtown Food Bank"
  slug: "downtown"  # Used in URLs
  admin:
    email: "admin@downtown.org"
    name: "Admin User"
  settings:
    timezone: "America/New_York"
    language: "en-US"
  # Future configurations (not yet implemented)
  advanced:
    domain: "downtown.foodbank.org"  # Coming soon
    storage:
      quota: "10GB"                  # Coming soon
      type: "premium"                # Coming soon
    features:                        # Coming soon
      - analytics
      - api_access
      - bulk_operations
```

### 3. User Management

Current capabilities:
- Create tenant administrators
- Basic user roles (Admin, Staff, User)
- Basic permissions
- Custom roles
- Fine-grained permissions
- User quotas

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Features
- Tenant data isolation
- User authentication
- Basic role-based access
- Session management

### Planned Security Enhancements
- Enhanced audit logging
- IP whitelisting
- 2FA requirement option
- SSO integration
- Advanced encryption options

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Audits**
   - Review active users
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Check access patterns

2. **Resource Management**
   - Monitor database usage
   - Track API usage
   - Watch storage consumption

3. **Security**
   - Regular permission reviews
   - Security log monitoring
   - Access pattern analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   ```
   Error: Could not connect to tenant database
   ```
   - Check database credentials
   - Verify tenant configuration
   - Ensure database server is running

2. **User Access Problems**
   ```
   Error: User not authorized for tenant
   ```
   - Verify user-tenant association
   - Check role assignments
   - Review permission settings

## Development Status

The multi-tenant system is being developed incrementally:

### Phase 1 (Current) 
- Basic tenant isolation
- User management
- Role-based access

### Phase 2 (In Progress) 
- Custom domains
- Resource quotas
- Enhanced monitoring

### Phase 3 (Planned) 
- Advanced security features
- Analytics dashboard
- Automated scaling
