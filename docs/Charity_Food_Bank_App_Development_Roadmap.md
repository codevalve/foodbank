# Charity Food Bank App - Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Charity Food Bank App, focusing on delivering an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) quickly and efficiently.

## Development Phases and Milestones

### Phase 1: Discovery and Planning (2-4 Weeks)
- **Define MVP Scope**:
  - Core features: Inventory management, volunteer scheduling, and client tracking.
  - Multi-tenant foundation: User roles, scoped data for each charity.
- **Technology Stack Selection**:
  - Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Vite.
  - Database: Subpabase.
  - Frontend: Vue.js.
  - Hosting: Netlify.
  - Authentication: JWT-based authentication - Supabase.
- **Design the Data Model**:
  - Define tables for charities (tenants), users, inventory, clients, and volunteers.
- **Wireframes and UI Design**:
  - Create wireframes for essential screens (dashboard, inventory, volunteer schedules).

### Phase 3: Beta Launch and Feedback (4 Weeks)
- **Internal Testing**:
  - Test with 1-2 local charities for usability and functionality.
- **Feedback Collection**:
  - Gather input from charities on core modules.
- **Bug Fixes and Iteration**:
  - Address high-priority issues before the public launch.

## Development Workflow and Practices

### Git Flow Strategy
- **Main Branches**:
  - `main`: Production-ready code
  - `development`: Integration branch for features and fixes
- **Supporting Branches**:
  - `feature/*`: New features (branched from development)
  - `fix/*`: Bug fixes (branched from development)
  - `release/*`: Release preparation
  - `hotfix/*`: Urgent production fixes (branched from main)

### Version Control Practices
- **Commit Messages**: Follow Conventional Commits specification
  - `feat:` New features
  - `fix:` Bug fixes
  - `docs:` Documentation changes
  - `chore:` Maintenance tasks
  - `refactor:` Code refactoring
  - `test:` Adding or modifying tests

### Release Management
- Use Standard Version for semantic versioning
- Automated CHANGELOG generation from conventional commits
- Release tags follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

### Development Process
1. **Feature/Fix Initiation**:
   - Create branch from development (`feature/*` or `fix/*`)
   - Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/inventory-management`)

2. **Development**:
   - Write code following project standards
   - Include relevant tests
   - Keep commits focused and conventional

3. **Code Review**:
   - Create Pull Request to development branch
   - Peer review required
   - All tests must pass
   - Code style checks must pass

4. **Merge & Deploy**:
   - Squash and merge to development
   - Delete feature branch after merge
   - Automated deployment to development environment

### Quality Standards
- All new features require tests
- Maintain code coverage above 80%
- Follow Vue.js and Node.js best practices
- Use TypeScript for type safety where beneficial

### Environments
- **Development**: Latest features (development branch)
- **Staging**: Release candidates (release branch)
- **Production**: Stable releases (main branch)
