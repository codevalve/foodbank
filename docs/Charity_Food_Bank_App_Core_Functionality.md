# Charity Food Bank App - Core Functionality

This document outlines the core functionality of the Charity Food Bank App, focusing on the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) features and their implementation.

## Core Functionalities

### 1. Inventory Management
- **Item Tracking**: Add, update, and delete inventory items (e.g., food, supplies).
- **Stock Levels**: Monitor stock levels and set alerts for low inventory.
- **Categories**: Organize items by categories (e.g., canned goods, perishables, hygiene products).
- **Check-In/Check-Out**: Record incoming donations and outgoing distributions.
- **Reporting**: Generate inventory reports (e.g., weekly, monthly summaries).

### 2. Volunteer Scheduling and Planning
- **Shift Management**: Create and manage volunteer shifts.
- **Volunteer Profiles**: Maintain a database of volunteer contact info, availability, and skills.
- **Sign-Up Portal**: Allow volunteers to sign up for available shifts.
- **Notifications**: Send shift reminders or alerts via email/SMS.

### 3. Client/Recipient Management
- **Client Records**: Store basic details of individuals or families receiving aid.
- **Service Logs**: Track services provided to clients over time.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Allow clients to book appointments for food pickups or services.

### 4. Administrative Features
- **User Roles**: Admins (full access) vs. Volunteers (restricted access).
- **Reporting**: Visualize key metrics (e.g., number of clients served, volunteer hours).
- **Announcements**: Post updates for volunteers or clients (e.g., closures, events).

### 5. Donation Tracking
- **Donor Records**: Track donors and donation history.
- **Financial Contributions**: Optionally manage financial donations.
- **Donation Needs**: Highlight priority items for donation.

### 6. Communication Tools
- **Email Templates**: Pre-configured messages for donors, clients, and volunteers.
- **Group Messaging**: Notify specific groups (e.g., volunteers, clients) about urgent updates.

## Future Considerations for Multi-Tenant Support
### Tenant-Specific Features
- **Data Segregation**: Ensure each charity's data is securely separated.
- **Custom Branding**: Allow each tenant to configure their own branding and settings.
- **Scalability**: Build APIs to support external integrations and high usage.
